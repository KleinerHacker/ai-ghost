 * Colour schemes the application theme can be dressed in.
 *
 * A scheme is a single stylesheet that defines nothing but the palette variables of the theme. The
 * base stylesheet and every component stylesheet reference those variables only, so exchanging the
 * scheme exchanges the complete appearance.
 *
 * Adding another scheme means adding a stylesheet next to the existing ones that defines exactly the
 * same variables, plus a constant here - nothing else in the code base has to change.
 *
 * @property path resource path of the stylesheet carrying the palette of this scheme
