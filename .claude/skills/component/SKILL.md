# Java FX Components

## Template

* The template is located here: `app/ui/src/main/kotlin/org/pcsoft/app/aighost/app/ui/component`
  * ONLY the files `ProjectList*.kt` are relevant
  * Their design and architecture MUST be adopted (Component, View, ViewModel)

## Structure

* The FXML always contains the component content
  * The content is fully defined there
  * The `fx:root` notation MUST be used
* The component is assembled through any FX Node class
  * Integration always happens via `root`

## Model Binding

* A component editing project data MUST be bound to the FX property model of `lib/fx-model`
  * The component MUST NOT copy the data and MUST NOT own a state of its own
  * The property model is handed in from outside as the single interface of the component
* The binding MUST be released when the bound model object is exchanged, and built up anew for the
  new object
* Both directions MUST be proven by tests on the real controls, as described in the `testing` skill

## Location

* Component classes MUST be placed under the root package in `ui.component`
  * Every required class MUST be placed in its own file
* Component FXML MUST be placed in the same directory within the resource directory
