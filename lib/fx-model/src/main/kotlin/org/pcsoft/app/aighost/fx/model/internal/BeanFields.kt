/**
 * The field properties of one property model and their connection to the object behind it.
 *
 * A property model registers every field it offers here once, in the order the fields are declared,
 * and calls [rebind] whenever the object it wraps is exchanged. From then on each field property is
 * tied to the matching field of that object through a `JavaBean*Property`, so a write on either side
 * reaches the other one without the model holding a value of its own.
 *
 * The name a field is registered under is the name of the property on the wrapped object - the
 * builders of `javafx.beans.property.adapter` look up its accessors by that name. A name that does
 * not exist is only noticed when the object is bound, which is why every field needs a test.
 *
 * An adapter reads the field it is tied to when it is told to, not when the field changes: a plain
 * object reports nothing. A value that was written on the wrapped object past the model is therefore
 * taken over by [refresh] and only then. A field carrying a model object of its own is registered
 * through [model] and hands that call on into its own fields, so one [refresh] covers the whole tree
 * below this model and a nested model cannot be forgotten.
 *
 * [fireEvent] lets the model report a change of one of its fields as a change of its own, so a change
 * deep in the object tree reaches everyone listening further up. A field taking over the value of a
 * freshly bound or freshly read object is not reported that way: the model announces that itself.
