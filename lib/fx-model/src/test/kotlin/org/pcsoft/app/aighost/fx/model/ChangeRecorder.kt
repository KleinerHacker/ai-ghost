/**
 * Counts the change events of a whole property tree, one counter per watched property.
 *
 * A view of the user interface never listens on the property itself, it hangs a binding on it and
 * reacts to the change of that binding. The recorder does the same: every watched property gets a
 * binding on the text form of its value, and a listener on that binding counts how often the value
 * behind it really changed. That is the event a bound control would receive, so a property that
 * stays quiet here would leave a stale value on screen.
 *
 * The text form is the `toString` of the value. All model objects are data classes, so their text
 * form covers the nested objects as well - a change deep inside the tree therefore also shows up on
 * every property above it, which is exactly what the propagation to the root has to achieve.
